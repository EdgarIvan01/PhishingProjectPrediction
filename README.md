# URL-Based Phishing Detector Using Naive Bayes

## Introduction

Phishing is a significant threat to online security, where attackers use deceptive URLs to obtain sensitive information from users. This project focuses on developing a URL-based phishing detector using the Naive Bayes (NB) algorithm.

## Objective

The main objective is to design and evaluate a classification model that identifies phishing URLs with high accuracy and low false positives. To do so, we focus on:

1. **Feature Extraction:** URL length, special characters, subdomains, HTTPS usage, among others.
2. **Model Training:** Using a labeled dataset to train the NB model.
3. **Model Evaluation:** Measuring performance with metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and false positive rate.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection:** Legitimate and phishing URLs.
2. **Preprocessing:** Cleaning and feature extraction from URLs.
3. **Training and Evaluation:** Implementation of the NB algorithm and cross-validation of the model.
4. **Optimization:** Parameter tuning to improve performance.

## Document Structure

1. **Literature Review:** Existing methods in phishing detection.
2. **Dataset Description:** Details about the dataset collection and characteristics.
3. **Methodology:** Steps in the implementation and evaluation of the model.
4. **Results:** Analysis of the results obtained.
